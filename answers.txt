1.Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read?
I have found Numpy to be slightly easier just becouse, I have used it before in my Linear ALgebra course, I had to solve complex matrix and vector problems. I had the choice to use MATLAB but for the love of programming in Python, I choose to work with Numpy which at the time I knew they were really powerful with array. I also like Pandas for the beautiful display and less complex syntax but Numpy will always be my numnber 1 priority.
2. What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?
My Pandas function has 53 ms ± 5.19 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each) where as the other (pivot_months_loops(data)) had 1.19 s ± 133 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
. My function clearly has a shorter running time since I have utilized prebuilt Pandas functions and API where as the other one had a lot of complex and hard coded stuff, I was hoping that it would take longer to do the same task like the professor said on our first lecture "why write your own code which is much more slower when there are libraries/modules out there that can do it faster and in a more efficient way"
